<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a M.S. student in statistics department at the University of Chicago. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Wei Biao Wu](https://stat.uchicago.edu/people/profile/wei-biao-wu/), Professor [Sen Na](https://senna1128.github.io/), and Professor [Wanrong Zhu](https://zhuwr0423.github.io/). My research interests include:

- **Stochastic optimization**
- **Online statistical inference**
- **Reinforcement learning**
- **Artificial Intelligence**


Prior to Uchicago, I obtained my B.S. degree in Mathematics from ShanghaiTech University in 2023, under the supervision of Profesor [Shixiao Jiang](https://willingjiang.github.io/) and Professor [Chengjian Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lLmtBmwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). I also visited Yale University as an exchange student in 2022, where I am very fortunate to work with professor [John Lafferty](https://www.lafferty-lab.org/) and Professor [Rajit Manohar](https://csl.yale.edu/~rajit/) on [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) acceleration projects.


I will be a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at the Georgia Tech School of [IsyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) starting in Fall 2025!
